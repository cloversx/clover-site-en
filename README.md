# Clover Site — Canonical Archive

This repository maintains a canonical archive of writing and explorations across technology, society, and human experience.

It is not built for rapid content cycles or algorithmic feeds.

It exists to preserve the evolution of thought.

## Structure

Each article lives at:

/essays/<slug>/

This URL always represents the latest version.

Previous versions are preserved at:

/essays/<slug>/v1/
/essays/<slug>/v2/
...

Archived versions are immutable and self-canonical.

## Version Philosophy

Version numbers represent intellectual stages.

Minor corrections:
- Update `last_updated`
- Do not increment the version number

Major conceptual updates:
- Archive the current version
- Increment the version number
- Preserve both states

Conceptually distinct works are published under a new slug.

History is layered, not erased.

## Dates

- `first_published` marks when the idea first entered the archive.
- `last_updated` marks when the current form was last shaped.
- Archived versions remain fixed.

## Design Principle

This is not a content stream.

It is a structured archive for preserving thought over time —  
written not to conclude, but to continue thinking.
